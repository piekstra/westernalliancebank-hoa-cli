## Ground rules (this reads a real person's financial portal)

- **Never commit secrets or personal data.** The portal password, session
  cookie, and device token live only in the OS keychain. Nothing
  credential-like belongs in the repo, tests, fixtures, or commit messages.
- **Fixtures are scrubbed captures.** Structure is preserved exactly; every
  name, address, balance, amount, ID, and pre-signed URL is replaced with an
  obvious dummy. See [`tests/fixtures/README.md`](tests/fixtures/README.md) —
  and note that a test enforces it. Never commit a raw capture.
- **Read-only by default.** Every command observes. A command that mutates the
  portal must prompt for confirmation and require `--force` to proceed
  non-interactively (exit `6` otherwise).
- **Secrets never on argv or in logs.** Read them from the keychain or stdin.

## Dev loop

```console
$ make verify     # fmt-check + clippy -D warnings + tests + smoke — the CI gate
$ make test       # unit + integration (fully offline; no network, no creds)
$ make dev        # debug build, re-signed so keychain grants survive rebuilds
$ cargo run -- <command>
```

`make verify` is exactly what CI runs; a green local run predicts a green CI
run.

## Pull requests

1. Branch from `main`; keep the change focused.
2. Add or update tests. Contract tests load fixtures from disk — extend
   `tests/fixtures/` (scrubbed!) rather than inlining JSON blobs in test code.
3. Keep the human table and the `--json` DTO in sync. A breaking DTO change
   bumps its `schema` version suffix.
4. Update [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md) when you learn something new about the
   portal's endpoints, and the README when you change the command surface.
5. Run `make verify` and include what you tested.

## A note on the portal

AppFolio publishes no owner-portal API, so everything here is reverse-
engineered and can break when they ship a redesign. If a command starts
returning empty columns, check `docs/api.md` against a fresh capture
(`wabhoa api <path>`) — a renamed field is the usual culprit, and the contract
tests in `tests/fixture_shapes.rs` are where the fix gets pinned down.

Testing a change against the live portal needs a two-factor code, and AppFolio
rate-limits those. The whole test suite is offline for exactly that reason;
please keep it that way.
